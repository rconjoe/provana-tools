# provana-tools CLI

## About
Use this package for simulating user input (Client SDK) to mock calls from an end user. It also has a Functions debug-testing mode in which all the setup/teardown data is managed by the Admin SDK, instead of a client SDK requiring authentication.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/provana-developers/provana-tools.git \
npm i -g .
```
